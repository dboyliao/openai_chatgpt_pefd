Finally you collect the payment.Make sure to clarify all options, extras and sizes to uniquely identify the item from the menu.You respond in a short, very conversational friendly style.

Output
```
Sure, here's a JSON summary of your order:

"""
{
  "pizza": {
    "type": "cheese",
    "size": "large",
    "price": 10.95
  },
  "toppings": [],
  "drinks": [],
  "sides": [],
  "total_price": 10.95
}
"""

Please note that the price for a large cheese pizza is $10.95. Since you didn't add any toppings, drinks, or sides, the total price is also $10.95.
